   In June and July 1994, after three days of brainstorming with John Gage, the Director of Science for Sun, <hai><a href="./JamesGosling.jsp">James Gosling at Sun Microsystems </a></hai>, Joy, Naughton, Wayne Rosing, and Eric Schmidt, the team re-targeted the platform for the World Wide Web. They felt that with the advent of graphical web browsers like Mosaic, the Internet was on its way to evolving into the same highly interactive medium that they had envisioned for cable TV. As a prototype, Naughton wrote a small browser, WebRunner (named after the movie Blade Runner), later renamed HotJava.

             That year, the  <hai> <a href="./Planguage.jsp">programming language </a> </hai> was renamed Java after a trademark search revealed that Oak was used by Oak Technology.[13] Although Java 1.0a was available for download in 1994, the first public release of Java was 1.0a2 with the HotJava browser on May 23, 1995, announced by Gage at the SunWorld conference. His announcement was accompanied by a surprise announcement by Marc Andreessen, Executive Vice President of Netscape Communications Corporation, that Netscape browsers would be including Java support. On January 9, 1996, the JavaSoft group was formed by Sun Microsystems to develop the technology
