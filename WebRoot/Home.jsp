   e propose a genetic programming approach to record deduplication that combines several different pieces of evidence
extracted from the data content to find a deduplication function that is able to identify whether two entries in a repository are replicas or
not. As shown by our experiments, our approach outperforms an existing state-of-the-art method found in the literature. Moreover, the
suggested functions are computationally less demanding since they use fewer evidence. In addition, our genetic programming
approach is capable of automatically adapting these functions to a given fixed replica identification boundary, freeing the user from the
burden of having to choose and tune this parameter.
