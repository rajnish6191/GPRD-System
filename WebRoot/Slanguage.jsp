    A scripting language or script language is a programming language that supports the writing of scripts, programs written for a software environment that automate the execution of tasks which could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Environments that can be automated through scripting include software applications, web pages within a web browser, the shells of operating systems (OS), and several general purpose and domain-specific languages such as those for embedded systems.
Scripting is usually a property of the primary implementations of a language, rather than a language per se, although many languages are not very suited to this kind of implementation. For example, C++ interpreters do exist, but C++ is generally not considered a scripting language for two reasons: these implementations are rarely used, and the time required to write program in C++ would be far greater than the time required to write an equivalent script in a language like Python. <br>
